# k3ai-plugins
K3ai plugins Repo is the place where we host all the  optional capabilites of k3ai. 
The main goal of the repo is to mantainer k3ai simple and lightweight while adding capabilites in the form of manifests or helm charts.
Where is possible we will create a simple re-direction to the orginal repo's 

## Note
Always insert a small readme file in each folder where to link the original work, authors and any useful information. We contribute to the community and work with it!
